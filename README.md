Thank you for using my open source project.

How to set up. First install python
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-395/ then run the bat file


Once you have python installed and ran the bat files you have to make a bot and get your bot token
https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token/

Once you have done that open the Bot.py file in notepad And scroll all the way down till you see bot.run(" TOKEN HERE"), Put your bot token there then save the file and run the py file.


Anybody is free to use this as long as you give some form of credit :D
